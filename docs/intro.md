## Prerequisite

### For Web

1. **VPS Hosting:** A Virtual Private Server (VPS) is **mandatory** to ensure reliable performance and security. Shared hosting environments are not supported for this **web application**.
2. **Node.js Support:** The server must support **Node.js**, as it is essential for running the application.
3. **Memory Requirements:** The server should have at least **3-4 GB of free RAM** to handle the application's processes effectively.
4. **SSH Root Access:** The server must provide **SSH root access** to execute Node.js commands and manage the application.

### For Admin Panel

1. **PHP Version:** Eclassify Admin panel is built using **Laravel Framework 10.0** so you need PHP version **minimum 8.1.0 or higher version** installed on your server.

### For App

1. **Flutter Version:** Flutter stable channel **3.32.2** sdk version
2. **Java Version:** JDK version **22**

**Note:** A **VPS server** is only required if you plan to use the **web application**. For hosting the web app, a VPS server is mandatory to ensure proper functionality and performance. However, if you are only using the **mobile app** and the **admin panel**, you can opt for a **shared hosting server** as it is sufficient for these components.
